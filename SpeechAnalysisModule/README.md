Install everything in requirements.txt

`test_vosk.py` should work.

WIP:
1. `test_vosk_vad.py` is still WIP.
2. Colab notebook for model adaptation is still WIP. Need to change domain words to what the other models are using.

Good to have/ look into:
1. Noise filtering (May result in accuracy drop)
2. Multi-language (expect accuracy drop)
